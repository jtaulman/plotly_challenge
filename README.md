# Plotly Challenge

## Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to find different types of Microbial Species in different people's belly buttons. All of this information is supposed to be put in a workable website, that filters information by Test Subject ID.

## Results

When the Test Subject ID is chosen their information appears as shown below. There is a bar chart breaking down the top 10 Microbial Species, 

A gauge expressing the amount of times that subject washes their belly buttons per week,


Finally a bubble chart.

## Summary

Each Subject ID changes the information shown on the website. The information is broken down into a bar chart, bubble chart, gauge, and demographics of each subject. There is no overall data that describes all test subjects. For the next analysis, there should be a better model for all the subjects and their data. That way it would be easier to find commonalities between all subjects. This data right now does a very good job describing each individual and the species that are found inside their belly button.
